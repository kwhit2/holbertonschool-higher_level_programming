- 1-write_file.py - function that writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written
- 2-append_write.py - function that appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added
- 3-to_json_string.py - function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string)
- 4-from_json_string.py - function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string
- 5-save_to_json_file.py - function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation
- 6-load_from_json_file.py -  function that creates an Object from a “JSON file”
- 7-add_item.py - script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file
- 8-class_to_json.py - function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure (list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean) for JSON serialization of an object
- 9-student.py - class Student that defines a student by public attributes: first_name, last_name, age. Contains public method (def to_json(self):) that retrieves a dictionary representation of a Student instance
- 10-student.py - class Student that defines a student by: (based on 9-student.py)
- 11-student.py class Student that defines a student by: (based on 10-student.py)
- 12-pascal_triangle.py - function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of n. Returns an empty list if n<=0
- 100-append_after.py -  function that inserts a line of text to a file, after each line containing a specific string
- 101-stats.py - script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics
